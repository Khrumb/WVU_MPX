Functions:
TurnOff: shuts down mpx machine when command is entered and y is received as a response
        parameters: takes in a char which can be y or n
        returns: shut down signal
Help: shows the user what commands they have access to
        parameters: takes in a string
        returns: list of all available commands for the user and what they do
Version: simple command from user returns software version (r1 for example)
itoa: converts integer variable to a string
        parameters: takes in an integer value and decimal base value
        returns: a character pointer to the new string integer
BCDtoDec: converts a BCD character to a decimal character
        parameters: takes in a character bcd
        returns: a character integer value
DectoBCD: converts a decimal character to a BCD character
        parameters: takes in an integer value
        returns: a character bcd
formatNum: converts ASCII characters to number values
 	parameters: a number character
 	returns: an integer
asciiToDec: converts ASCII characters to number values
 	parameters: a number character
	returns: an integer
strlen: finds the length of a given string
        parameters: takes in a character string
        returns: the length of the string passed in, as int
getTime: returns the current time to the user
getDate: returns the current date to the user
parseTime: parses the user input and sets the internal clock if valid input is given
 	parameters: character buffer from the user
 	returns: a boolean integer whether the clock was set or not
setTime: allows the user to set system time
        parameters: character buffer from user containing new time
        returns: updates the system's time with the new time from the user
parseDate: parses the user input and sets the internal date if valid input is given
 	parameters: character buffer from the user
 	returns: a boolean integer whether the date was set or not
setDate: allows the user to set system date
        parameters: character buffer from user containing new date
        returns: updates the system's date with the new time from the user
parseCommand: parses the user's input in order to select a command
        parameters: a string (char pointer, command from the user)
        returns: the correct command is called
CommandHandler: handles the user's input in the command line. Function takes in the user's raw inputs and translates them into something our program can use. Also facilitates moving around in command line, such as left right, carriage return etc.
        parameters: input from COM1 from buffer
        returns: correct character or action on screen
Serial import: uses COM1 to get input from basic IO (later used by command Handler)
        parameters: input from keyboard
kMain.c initializations: Global Descriptor Table, programmable interrupt controller, paging
strcpy: copies a string to create a new string which is a copy of the original
        parameters:  takes in a char pointer s1 as source and constant char pointer as dest
        returns: pointer to the destination string
atoi: converts a string to int
        parameters: const char
        returns: value of char as an integer
strcmp: compares 2 string for length and returns difference
        parameters: takes in 2 strings (char pointers)
        returns: difference of strings
